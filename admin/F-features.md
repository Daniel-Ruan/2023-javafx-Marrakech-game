additional features...
We utilize a traditional game interface combined with a simple UI to provide players with an excellent gaming experience.

The game employs the mouse for all actions, with the mouse wheel controlling the rotation of the Rug and Assam, and left-clicks to complete and confirm operations.

There is a game restart button in the bottom right corner of the screen, making it convenient for players to restart the game.
