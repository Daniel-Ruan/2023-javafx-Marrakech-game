```java
public static char getWinner(String gameState) {
    // Step 1: 提取玩家信息并创建玩家对象数组
    String[] playerInfoArray = Player.extractPlayerInfo(gameState);
    Player[] players = new Player[4];
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        players[i] = Player.fromString(playerInfoArray[i]);
    }

    String boardString = Board.extractBoardPart(gameState);
    // Step 2: 为每个玩家计算得分
    Board board = new Board();
    board.populateBoardFromString(boardString);

    char currentWinner = 'n';
    int highestScore  = -1;
    int highestDirhams  = -1;
    boolean isTie = false;

    for (Player player : players) {
        if (player.isActive()) {  // Only consider active players
            char color = player.getColor();
            int playerScore = player.getDirhams() + board.getRugCountForColor(color);
            if (playerScore > highestScore) {
                highestScore = playerScore;
                highestDirhams = player.getDirhams();
                currentWinner = color;
                isTie = false;  // New winner found, so reset the tie flag
            } else if (playerScore == highestScore) {
                if (player.getDirhams() > highestDirhams) {
                    highestDirhams = player.getDirhams();
                    currentWinner = color;
                    isTie = false;  // New winner found based on dirhams, so reset the tie flag
                } else if (player.getDirhams() == highestDirhams) {
                    isTie = true;  // Potential tie situation
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return isTie ? 't' : currentWinner;

}

The given method `getWinner` aims to determine the winner of a game given a `gameState` string. The winner is determined based on player scores, and in case of ties, the number of dirhams.

**Advantages:**

1. **Scalability**: The code is designed to handle multiple players (in this case, 4 players), making it scalable for different game configurations without major modifications.
2.  **Flexibility**: The code can be easily adapted for different game rules or scoring mechanisms by modifying specific parts of the logic. It allows for flexibility in game design.
3.  **Maintainability**: The code separates different aspects of the game (player information, board state) into distinct components, enhancing maintainability. Changes in one area are less likely to affect other parts of the code.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Comments**: While the method has some comments, adding a few more comments detailing complex logic or decisions would further improve readability.
2. **Code Efficiency:** Analyze the algorithm's time complexity and optimize the code if needed, especially if this function is expected to run on large datasets.
